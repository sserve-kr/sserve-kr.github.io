# The Basic Method To Alternate INCLUDE in Flask

Flask does not have a method to include other html file like vue.js, or something like that.  
The only thing that can be said "simillar" is a {% raw %}`{% block %}`{% endraw %} method.  
  
But, I don't really like that method.  
I thought it could be more simple if I write that with include.  


So I found the way to alternate include method, without block thing.  

## render_template
We are using `render_template()` function to render a template(HTML file).  
So, What returned when we call `render_template()`?  
A string.  
More accurately, a string filled with given contexts.  

Then, what about giving **rendered template** with `render_template()` in `render_template()`?  
Like this:
{% raw %}
```python
# main.py
return render_template(
    'views/index.html', 
    btn=render_template(
        'components/button.html',
        text='include!'
    ),
    title="hello world!"
 )
```
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
```HTML
<!-- templates/views/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    {{ btn }}
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
```HTML
<!-- templates/components/button.html -->
<button>{{ text }}</button>
```
{% endraw %}
{% raw %}
So, second render_template, the button component returns button filled with given text.  
Then the first render_template puts rendered button in `{{ btn }}`  
{% endraw %}
In this way, we can use it like including things.
